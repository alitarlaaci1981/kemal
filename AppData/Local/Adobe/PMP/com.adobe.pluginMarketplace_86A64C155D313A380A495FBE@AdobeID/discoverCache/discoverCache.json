After the end of the Promotional Period, you must create a Pantone account and pay subscription charges for access to the Premium Services.  \rPantone currently offers the Premium Services on a monthly or annual subscription basis to be paid in full as of the start of the term.

For accounts that are subject to automatic renewal, you consent to the automatic debit of your credit card in the amount of the then current subscription fees for your type of subscription. We reserve the right to suspend access to the Premium Services if our third party payment processor is unable to process your renewal subscription fees and no other form of payment is provided.\rFinally, the Application may also allow you to purchase additional services and products directly through the Apple Store or Google Play store  (”In-App Purchases”).

The Parties acknowledge that each Party, in the course of entering into the Agreement and using the Platform may obtain information relating to: (a) the Customer and its business; including Customer Information; (b) the Platform; and (c) Iconik and its business, which is of a confidential and proprietary nature (”Confidential Information”). Such Confidential Information may include, but is not limited to trade secrets, know how, invention techniques, records, processes, programs, schematics, software source documents, data, content, photos, videos, illustrations, articles, animations, metadata, customer lists, financial information, and sales and marketing plans or any other information which is reasonably deemed confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the Parties. The Parties shall at all times, both during the Term and for a period of at least five (5) years after termination or expiry of this Agreement, for whatever reason (or for such other longer period as the Confidential Information may be protected by law), keep all Confidential Information confidential, and shall not use such Confidential Information other than as expressly authorized by the other Party under the Agreement, nor shall either party disclose any such Confidential Information to third parties without the other Party's prior written consent. 5.2. Upon termination of the Agreement, Customer shall have a period of thirty (30) days to download and/or retrieve all Customer Information stored and/or used via the Platform 4(7) and/or software (the ”Customer Data Transmission Period”), provided that Customer has purchased or purchases credits for the Customer Data Transmission Period. 5.3. Following the end of the Customer Data Transmission Period, Customer may request (at its discretion) in writing that Iconik either deletes or destroys all Customer Information. If such request has not been received by Iconik within ten (10) days following the end of the Customer Data Transmission Period, Iconik shall be entitled to delete and/or destroy such Customer Information. 5.4. Customer agrees to immediately return to Iconik, or upon Iconik's request, destroy, all Iconik ́s proprietary and/or Confidential Information (including copies thereof) in Customer ́s possession, custody or control upon termination of the Agreement and the end of the Customer Data Transmission Period, for whatever reason. Customer shall further certify in writing that all mentioned materials and documentation has been returned or destroyed. 5.5. The obligations of confidentiality in this section 5 shall not apply to information which: a) has entered the public domain, except where such entry is the result of breach of the Agreement; b) prior to disclosure hereunder was already legally in the recipient ́s possession; c) subsequent to disclosure hereunder is obtained by the recipient on a non- confidential basis from a third party who has the right to disclose such information to the recipient; d) a Party is required to disclose under applicable law or regulation (including applicable stock exchange or market place regulations) or by court or governmental order; provided that the disclosure shall, so far as practicable, be made after consultation with the other Party and after taking into account the other Party's reasonable requirements as to its timing, content and manner of making or dispatch 5.6. Customer hereby grants Iconik the right to use the Customer ́s logotype and name for customer reference, information and marketing purposes (including use on website/s, at fairs, trade shows, market events and/or presentations, etc.). 5.7. The confidentiality undertakings set out in this section 5 shall also apply with respect to all and any user of Customer ́s account. 6. TERM AND TERMINATION 6.1. The term of the Agreement shall commence on signature (which may be made electronically by your representative/user clicking ”agree” or similar) and continue until either Party terminates the Agreement in accordance with this section 6 (the ”Term”). 6.2. Customer may choose to terminate its account and the Agreement at any time. In order to terminate the account and this Agreement, please send an e-mail to accounts@iconik.io. Customer will however always be able to use any remaining credits and the account will be terminated once the credits are no longer sufficient to cover Customer ́s use. 6.3. Iconik may terminate the account or suspend Customer ́s or any authorized user's access to the Platform at any time, including in the event of actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Platform and/or its content, or non-compliance with the Terms, however, 5(7) Customer (and its authorized users) shall be permitted to continue using the Platform if it has any purchased credits on its account until such credits are used up (such period, however, shall not exceed thirty (30) days), after which this Agreement shall terminate. 6.4. Iconik is entitled to terminate the account with immediate effect: a) if Customer enters into bankruptcy or reconstruction, composition proceedings, suspends payments, enters into liquidation or in any other way can be assumed to have become insolvent, or b) if Customer is in material breach of any provision of the Agreement and fails to remedy such violation within thirty (30) days after having received written notice by Iconik of said breach. 6.5. Any breach of the terms in sections 4 and 5 shall always be regarded a material breach which entitles Iconik to terminate the account with immediate effect. 6.6. Upon the termination of the account, for whatever reason, the following provisions of the Terms will still apply: 1.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, 8.1 and 8.2. 7. MISCELLANEOUS 7.1. The Agreement, together with any additional terms and conditions (e.g. terms regarding charges/credits and usage metrics, etc., as set out on the Platform), constitutes the entire agreement between Customer and Iconik and thus supersedes all previous understandings, whether oral or in writing, between the Parties on the same subject. 7.2. Neither Party may, in whole or in part, transfer, assign or pledge the Agreement or any rights or obligations thereunder, without the prior written approval of the other Party. Any assignment attempted without the written consent of the other Party will be null and void. Iconik will however be entitled to assign, in whole or in part, the Agreement, or any rights or obligations thereunder, to any Iconik Affiliate (where ”Iconik Affiliate” means any parent company, sister company or subsidiary of Iconik as determined by direct or indirect ownership of more than 50 percent of the issued share capital and/or votes), subject to notice of the assignment to the Customer. Iconik shall also be entitled to assign, in whole or part, the Agreement, or any rights or obligations thereunder, in case of a merger, acquisition, divestiture, division or other business transition, subject to notice of the assignment to the Customer. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 7.3. Iconik is entitled to change the Terms during the Term of your use of the Platform provided that Customer has been informed of such change not less than thirty (30) calendar days in advance. In the event of such change Customer is entitled to terminate the account in accordance with section 6. Such termination must be made not less than ten (10) calendar days prior to the change of Terms taking effect. If Customer does not terminate the account as just said, this will constitute an acceptance by Customer of the change of the Terms. 7.4. If any provision of the Terms or part thereof is held invalid, this shall not affect the remaining provisions of the Terms. 7.5. A Party is relieved from liability for a failure to perform any of its obligations due to any circumstance beyond its immediate reasonable control, which impedes, delays, or aggravates any obligation to be fulfilled by said Party under the Agreement, such as acts 6(7) of authorities, war, acts of war, labor disputes, blockades, major accidents and currency restrictions. 8. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTES 8.1. The Agreement, including the Terms, shall be construed in accordance with and be governed by the laws of Sweden. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with the contract, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (the ”SCC”). The Rules for Expedited Arbitrations shall apply, unless the SCC in its discretion determines, taking into account the complexity of the case, the amount in dispute and other circumstances, that the Arbitration Rules shall apply. In the latter case, the SCC shall also decide whether the Arbitral Tribunal shall be composed of one or three arbitrators. The seat of arbitration shall be Stockholm and the language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English, unless both Parties agree in writing to use the Swedish language. 8.2. The Parties undertake, without any limitation in time, not to disclose the content of any contract negotiations, as well as the presence or content of an arbitration award arising from the Agreement or information regarding negotiations, arbitration or mediation arising from the Agreement. What is stated in this section 8.2 applies unless otherwise is prescribed by law, statute, authority regulations, stock exchange regulations or good practice on the stock market or otherwise required for the enforcement of a judgement"},"publishedAt":"2019-06-26T08:32:41.000+0000","packageSize":9487120,"screenshots":[{"width":0,"height":0,"href":"https://d32a1iuc7x840y.cloudfront.net/3/100304/650898b0-7853-4329-9fcc-3e2505e116cf.jpg"},{"width":0,"height":0,"href":"https://d32a1iuc7x840y.cloudfront.net/3/100304/7572eef8-536c-4e3e-8851-8a20dfd88f18.jpg"},{"width":0,"height":0,"href":"https://d32a1iuc7x840y.cloudfront.net/3/100304/aac5aa10-5bdc-41f0-8a35-3cea4cb6d891.jpg"},{"width":0,"height":0,"href":"https://d32a1iuc7x840y.cloudfront.net/3/100304/862854f2-f3fb-4422-99ac-2d5ca74f0e50.jpg"},{"width":0,"height":0,"href":"https://d32a1iuc7x840y.cloudfront.net/3/100304/51170d3b-e3d8-4cfc-afe4-0c3523a582b7.jpg"}],"dependency":{"app":{"requireInstallation":false,"platforms":[]},"service":{"serviceSignIn":false,"requiresPayment":false}},"hostAppMapping":[{"hostAppCode":"AEFT","minVersion":"15.0","maxVersion":"18.99"},{"hostAppCode":"AUDT","minVersion":"11.0","maxVersion":"14.99"},{"hostAppCode":"AUDT","minVersion":"11.0","maxVersion":"14.99"},{"hostAppCode":"PHSP","minVersion":"19.0","maxVersion":"23.99"},{"hostAppCode":"PHSP","minVersion":"19.0","maxVersion":"23.99"},{"hostAppCode":"PPRO","minVersion":"12.0","maxVersion":"15.99"},{"hostAppCode":"PPRO","minVersion":"12.0","maxVersion":"15.99"},{"hostAppCode":"AEFT","minVersion":"15.0","maxVersion":"18.99"},{"hostAppCode":"ILST","minVersion":"23.0","maxVersion":"25.99"},{"hostAppCode":"ILST","minVersion":"23.0","maxVersion":"25.99"},{"hostAppCode":"PHSP","minVersion":"19.0","maxVersion":"23.99"},{"hostAppCode":"AUDT","minVersion":"11.0","maxVersion":"14.99"},{"hostAppCode":"AEFT","minVersion":"15.0","maxVersion":"18.99"},{"hostAppCode":"PPRO","minVersion":"12.0","maxVersion":"15.99"},{"hostAppCode":"ILST","minVersion":"23.0","maxVersion":"25.99"}],"downloadable":true},"rating":{"histogram":{"rating1":0,"rating2":0,"rating3":0,"rating4":0,"rating5":0},"overallRating":0},"type":"ZXP","uniqueDownloadsCount":6655,"categoryIds":[],"icons":[{"width":96,"height":96,"href":"file:///C:\\Users\\kemal\\AppData\\Local\\Adobe\\PMP\\com.adobe.pluginMarketplace_86A64C155D313A380A495FBE@AdobeID\\discoverCache\\zxpImage\\f2ee072c-e694-426f-bac8-c4c9b29d007a.jpg"}],"localizedMetadata":{"name":"iconik","summary":"Panel for iconik customers and requires an iconik account.","keywords":[]},"pricingInfo":{"price":0,"buyUrl":null,"subscription":null},"compatibilityStatus":"compatible","isPluginAvailableOnExchange":true},{"id":"100257","bundleId":"com.adobeexchange.FilmstroWin.1519995914.7d1dec8a615a883a80bf7c07e83b8dc4","firstPublishedAt":"2018-03-05T02:17:04.000+0000","exchangeUrl":"https://exchange.adobe.com/creativecloud.details.100257.filmstro-win.html","owner":{"id":"0011400001rwX1VAAU","name":"Filmstro","website":null,"description":null,"logo":null},"version":{"id":"100348","versionString":"2.0.107","languageCodes":["en"],"localizedMetadata":{"description":"Filmstro comes with 5 free tracks with which to explore the entire full-cycle workflow. &#013;&#013;The Filmstro Panel has 3 main areas: &#013;&#013;1.

MISCELLANEOUS 7.1.

Upon termination of the Agreement, Customer shall have a period of thirty (30) days to download and/or retrieve all Customer Information stored and/or used via the Platform 4(7) and/or software (the ”Customer Data Transmission Period”), provided that Customer has purchased or purchases credits for the Customer Data Transmission Period. 5.3. Following the end of the Customer Data Transmission Period, Customer may request (at its discretion) in writing that Iconik either deletes or destroys all Customer Information. If such request has not been received by Iconik within ten (10) days following the end of the Customer Data Transmission Period, Iconik shall be entitled to delete and/or destroy such Customer Information. 5.4. Customer agrees to immediately return to Iconik, or upon Iconik's request, destroy, all Iconik ́s proprietary and/or Confidential Information (including copies thereof) in Customer ́s possession, custody or control upon termination of the Agreement and the end of the Customer Data Transmission Period, for whatever reason. Customer shall further certify in writing that all mentioned materials and documentation has been returned or destroyed. 5.5.

Customer hereby grants Iconik the right to use the Customer ́s logotype and name for customer reference, information and marketing purposes (including use on website/s, at fairs, trade shows, market events and/or presentations, etc.). 5.7.

The term of the Agreement shall commence on signature (which may be made electronically by your representative/user clicking ”agree” or similar) and continue until either Party terminates the Agreement in accordance with this section 6 (the ”Term”). 6.2. Customer may choose to terminate its account and the Agreement at any time. In order to terminate the account and this Agreement, please send an e-mail to accounts@iconik.io. Customer will however always be able to use any remaining credits and the account will be terminated once the credits are no longer sufficient to cover Customer ́s use. 6.3. Iconik may terminate the account or suspend Customer ́s or any authorized user's access to the Platform at any time, including in the event of actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Platform and/or its content, or non-compliance with the Terms, however, 5(7) Customer (and its authorized users) shall be permitted to continue using the Platform if it has any purchased credits on its account until such credits are used up (such period, however, shall not exceed thirty (30) days), after which this Agreement shall terminate. 6.4. Iconik is entitled to terminate the account with immediate effect: a) if Customer enters into bankruptcy or reconstruction, composition proceedings, suspends payments, enters into liquidation or in any other way can be assumed to have become insolvent, or b) if Customer is in material breach of any provision of the Agreement and fails to remedy such violation within thirty (30) days after having received written notice by Iconik of said breach. 6.5. Any breach of the terms in sections 4 and 5 shall always be regarded a material breach which entitles Iconik to terminate the account with immediate effect. 6.6. Upon the termination of the account, for whatever reason, the following provisions of the Terms will still apply: 1.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, 8.1 and 8.2. 7. MISCELLANEOUS 7.1. The Agreement, together with any additional terms and conditions (e.g. terms regarding charges/credits and usage metrics, etc., as set out on the Platform), constitutes the entire agreement between Customer and Iconik and thus supersedes all previous understandings, whether oral or in writing, between the Parties on the same subject. 7.2. Neither Party may, in whole or in part, transfer, assign or pledge the Agreement or any rights or obligations thereunder, without the prior written approval of the other Party. Any assignment attempted without the written consent of the other Party will be null and void. Iconik will however be entitled to assign, in whole or in part, the Agreement, or any rights or obligations thereunder, to any Iconik Affiliate (where ”Iconik Affiliate” means any parent company, sister company or subsidiary of Iconik as determined by direct or indirect ownership of more than 50 percent of the issued share capital and/or votes), subject to notice of the assignment to the Customer. Iconik shall also be entitled to assign, in whole or part, the Agreement, or any rights or obligations thereunder, in case of a merger, acquisition, divestiture, division or other business transition, subject to notice of the assignment to the Customer. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 7.3. Iconik is entitled to change the Terms during the Term of your use of the Platform provided that Customer has been informed of such change not less than thirty (30) calendar days in advance. In the event of such change Customer is entitled to terminate the account in accordance with section 6. Such termination must be made not less than ten (10) calendar days prior to the change of Terms taking effect. If Customer does not terminate the account as just said, this will constitute an acceptance by Customer of the change of the Terms. 7.4. If any provision of the Terms or part thereof is held invalid, this shall not affect the remaining provisions of the Terms. 7.5. A Party is relieved from liability for a failure to perform any of its obligations due to any circumstance beyond its immediate reasonable control, which impedes, delays, or aggravates any obligation to be fulfilled by said Party under the Agreement, such as acts 6(7) of authorities, war, acts of war, labor disputes, blockades, major accidents and currency restrictions. 8. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTES 8.1. The Agreement, including the Terms, shall be construed in accordance with and be governed by the laws of Sweden. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with the contract, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (the ”SCC”). The Rules for Expedited Arbitrations shall apply, unless the SCC in its discretion determines, taking into account the complexity of the case, the amount in dispute and other circumstances, that the Arbitration Rules shall apply. In the latter case, the SCC shall also decide whether the Arbitral Tribunal shall be composed of one or three arbitrators. The seat of arbitration shall be Stockholm and the language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English, unless both Parties agree in writing to use the Swedish language. 8.2. The Parties undertake, without any limitation in time, not to disclose the content of any contract negotiations, as well as the presence or content of an arbitration award arising from the Agreement or information regarding negotiations, arbitration or mediation arising from the Agreement.

Users can log in to AEM then select the namespaces they want to import into Bridge. Once imported, a new Custom Keywords panel called AEM Tags becomes available with all of the tags and their hierarchy. Users can then view, add, or change applied AEM Tags on assets. \r \rThe Custom Keywords infrastructure in Bridge also supports Metadata Templates, so users can select an image with applied AEM Tags and use it as a Template for other assets. \r \rThis panel is intended for customers with Adobe Experience Manager whose Creatives want to access to AEM Tags on assets managed by AEM. It also provides an interface for Creatives to manage AEM Tags on assets outside of AEM, such as photo shoot collections and documents that will be imported into AEM at a later date.\r \rAdmins can also create and export a Custom Metadata Panel XML file that they can share with their Creatives or with their external partners to help ensure compliance with metadata tagging on inbound assets.\r \rAEM stores AEM Tags on assets that support XMP. The AEM Tags Custom Keywords panel offers an interface to these values in XMP.  It is common for users to install the AEM Tags Extension and the AEM Desktop App, which is available at https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-3/administer/integration/aem-desktop-app.html\r\rIf your AEM Tags change on your server, you can simply log in to AEM and update your panel. Select the namespaces you want, and Generate a new panel. It will overwrite your existing panel, so you will need to restart Bridge or reload your Bridge window to see the changes.\r\rWhen you apply AEM Tags, you can see the raw tags at the top of the AEM Tags Custom Keywords panel. You can hide them by disabling Show Assigned Keywords in the flyout menu of the panel. You can also search for tags using the search bar at the bottom of the AEM Tags Custom Keywords panel.","releaseNotes":"Added support for Bridge 2021","helpUrl":null,"privacyPolicy":null,"licenseAgreement":null},"publishedAt":"2018-09-18T11:23:11.000+0000","packageSize":2534688,"screenshots":[{"width":0,"height":0,"href":"https://d32a1iuc7x840y.cloudfront.net/0/20009/4307c4d1-f0e9-4763-bdfd-d26412526dec.png"},{"width":0,"height":0,"href":"https://d32a1iuc7x840y.cloudfront.net/0/20009/79298894-a211-46d9-b321-3e823fe1a192.png"},{"width":0,"height":0,"href":"https://d32a1iuc7x840y.cloudfront.net/0/20009/72087020-5332-4977-a1c5-9b49b31196cf.png"},{"width":0,"height":0,"href":"https://d32a1iuc7x840y.cloudfront.net/0/20009/cda60f8a-ec52-4cc6-988c-642462e9ee6e.png"}],"dependency":{"app":{"requireInstallation":false,"platforms":[]},"service":{"serviceSignIn":false,"requiresPayment":false}},"hostAppMapping":[{"hostAppCode":"KBRG","minVersion":"8.0","maxVersion":null},{"hostAppCode":"KBRG","minVersion":"8.0","maxVersion":null},{"hostAppCode":"KBRG","minVersion":"8.0","maxVersion":null}],"downloadable":true},"rating":{"histogram":{"rating1":0,"rating2":0,"rating3":0,"rating4":0,"rating5":0},"overallRating":0},"type":"ZXP","uniqueDownloadsCount":1025,"categoryIds":[],"icons":[{"width":96,"height":96,"href":"file:///C:\\Users\\kemal\\AppData\\Local\\Adobe\\PMP\\com.adobe.pluginMarketplace_86A64C155D313A380A495FBE@AdobeID\\discoverCache\\zxpImage\\47c6fa7e-cc3c-41fb-8129-12301e6d6a77.png"}],"localizedMetadata":{"name":"AEM Tags Panel for Bridge CC","summary":"AEM Tags Panel for Bridge adds AEM Tags to Bridge as Custom Keywords","keywords":["Utilities","Extensions","Plug-ins","AEM","Metadata","Custom-Keywords","Keywords"]},"pricingInfo":{"price":0,"buyUrl":null,"subscription":null},"isPluginAvailableOnExchange":true,"compatibilityStatus":"incompatible","compatibilityReason":"not-app-compatible"},{"id":"19973","bundleId":"com.jameslockman.cep.tappecue","firstPublishedAt":"2019-03-06T12:53:37.000+0000","exchangeUrl":"https://exchange.adobe.com/creativecloud.details.19973.tappecue.html","owner":{"id":"0011O000020pssoQAA","name":"James Lockman","website":null,"description":"James is the manager of the Digital Media Services, Americas, team at Adobe.

To the extent that any provision in this section is in conflict with any other term or condition in this agreement, this section will supersede such other term or condition.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.1 Limited Warranty for Users Residing in Germany or Austria. If you obtained the Software in Germany or Austria, and you usually reside in such country, then Section 6 does not apply; instead, Adobe warrants that the Software provides the functionalities set forth in the Documentation (the &quot;agreed upon functionalities&quot;) for the limited warranty period following receipt of the Software when used on the recommended hardware configuration. As used in this Section, &quot;limited warranty period&quot; means one (1) year if you are a business user and two (2) years if you are not a business user. Non-substantial variation from the agreed upon functionalities will not and does not establish any warranty rights. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY TO SOFTWARE PROVIDED TO YOU FREE OF CHARGE, FOR EXAMPLE, UPDATES, PRE-RELEASE, TRYOUT, STARTER, PRODUCT SAMPLER AND NOT FOR RESALE (NFR) COPIES OF SOFTWARE, OR TO FONT SOFTWARE CONVERTED INTO OTHER FORMATS, WEB SITES, ONLINE SERVICES, CD SERVICES OR SOFTWARE THAT HAS BEEN ALTERED BY YOU, TO THE EXTENT SUCH ALTERATION CAUSED A DEFECT. To make a warranty claim, during the limited warranty period you must return, at our expense, the Software and proof of purchase to the location where you obtained it. If the functionalities of the Software vary substantially from the agreed upon functionalities, Adobe is entitled -- by way of re-performance and at its own discretion -- to repair or replace the Software. If this fails, you are entitled to a reduction of the purchase price (reduction) or to cancel the purchase agreement (rescission). For further warranty information, please contact the Adobe Customer Support Department.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.2 Limitation of Liability for Users Residing in Germany and Austria.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.2.1 If you obtained the Software in Germany or Austria, and you usually reside in such country, then Section 8 does not apply. Instead, subject to the provisions in Section 14.2.2, Adobe and its affiliates' statutory liability for damages will be limited as follows: (i) Adobe and its affiliates will be liable only up to the amount of damages as typically foreseeable at the time of entering into the purchase agreement in respect of damages caused by a slightly negligent breach of a material contractual obligation and (ii) Adobe and its affiliates will not be liable for damages caused by a slightly negligent breach of a non-material contractual obligation.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.2.2 The aforesaid limitation of liability will not apply to any mandatory statutory liability, in particular, to liability under the German Product Liability Act, liability for assuming a specific guarantee or liability for culpably caused personal injuries.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.2.3 You are required to take all reasonable measures to avoid and reduce damages, in particular to make back-up copies of the Software and your computer data subject to the provisions of this agreement.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.3 Pre-release Software Additional Terms.

The Tryout Software may contain limited functionality and is to be used for demonstration and evaluation purposes only and not for your commercial purposes. YOUR USE OF TRYOUT SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. SEE SECTIONS 7 and 8 FOR WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS WHICH GOVERN TRYOUT SOFTWARE.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.5 Time Out Software. If the Software is a timeout version then it will cease operations after a designated period of time or number of launches following installation. The license hereunder will terminate after such period or number of launches unless extended by Adobe upon your acquisition of a full retail license.

Use of the font software you have converted will be pursuant to all the terms and conditions of this agreement. Such converted font software may be used only for your own customary internal business or personal use and may not be distributed or transferred for any purpose, except in accordance with Section 4.4 of this agreement.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.7.5 You may embed copies of the font software into your electronic documents for the purpose of printing and viewing the document. If the font software you are embedding is identified as &quot;licensed for editable embedding&quot; on Adobe&acirc;&euro;&trade;s website at http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/embeddingeula.html , you may also embed copies of that font software for the additional purpose of editing your electronic documents. No other embedding rights are implied or permitted under this license.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.8 Online Services.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.8.1 The Software may rely upon or facilitate your access to websites maintained by Adobe or its affiliates or third parties offering goods, information, software and services (e.g., the Adobe Stock Photos service) (&quot;Online Services&quot;). Your access to and use of any website or online services is governed by the terms, conditions, disclaimers and notices found on such site or otherwise associated with such services, for example, the Terms of Use located at http://www.adobe.com/misc/copyright.html . Adobe may at any time, for any reason, modify or discontinue the availability of any website and Online Services.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.8.2 Adobe does not control, endorse or accept responsibility for websites or Online Services offered by third parties. Any dealings between you and any third party in connection with a website or Online Services, including delivery of and payment for goods and services and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such third party.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.8.3 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY AGREED BY ADOBE OR ITS AFFILIATES OR A THIRD PARTY IN A SEPARATE AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF WEBSITES AND ONLINE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK UNDER THE WARRANTY AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS OF SECTIONS 7 AND 8.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.9 After Effects Professional Render Engine. If the Software includes the full version of Adobe After Effects Professional, then you may install an unlimited number of Render Engines on Computers within your Internal Network that includes at least one Computer on which the full version of the Adobe After Effects Professional software is installed. The term &quot;Render Engine&quot; means an installable portion of the Software that allows After Effects projects to be rendered but cannot be used to create or modify projects and does not include the complete After Effects user interface.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.10 Version Cue Software. If the Software includes Adobe Creative Suite software and the Version Cue software components, then as an alternative to installing and using a single copy of the Version Cue Server component with the other components of the Software as permitted in Section 2.1, you may install the Version Cue Server component on one file server within your Internal Network and make it accessible by Computers on such Internal Network so long as your Internal Network includes at least one Computer on which Adobe Creative Suite software is installed. In addition, if you are in the business of providing creative services, then you may grant access to the Version Cue Server by clients who are outside of your Internal Network so long as all of the following criteria are met:&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;(1) You may only grant access to those of your clients to whom you are providing a larger creative service such as advertising, public relations, graphic design, etc.;&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;(2) You may only grant access for the purpose of enabling your clients to participate in, collaborate on, and contribute to creative projects that you are engaged in on their behalf;&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;(3) You may not charge a fee for access to, or use of, the Version Cue Server;&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;(4) You may not grant access to the Version Cue Server for any other purpose other than as specifically set forth herein or for any purpose that is independent of the creative service you are providing such as for the management of the client&acirc;&euro;&trade;s own projects;&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;(5) Your clients are not permitted to download copies of the Version Cue Server; and&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;(6) You comply with all other terms and conditions of this agreement.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;No other network use is permitted, including, but not limited to using the Software to enable web hosted workgroups or services available to the public.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.11 Certified Documents. If the Software allows you to author and validate Certified Documents, then this Section applies.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.11.1 Certified Documents and CD Services. A &quot;Certified Document&quot; or &quot;CD&quot; is a PDF file that has been digitally signed using (a) the Software CD feature set; (b) a certificate; and (c) a &quot;private&quot; encryption key that corresponds to the &quot;public&quot; key in the certificate. Authoring of a CD requires that you obtain a certificate from an authorized CD Service Provider. &quot;CD Service Provider&quot; is an independent third party service vendor listed at http://www.adobe.com/security/partners_cds.html . Validation of a CD requires CD Services from the CD Service Provider that issued the certificate. &quot;CD Services&quot; are services provided by CD Service Providers, including but not limited to (a) certificates issued by such CD Service Provider for use with the Software&acirc;&euro;&trade;s CD feature set; (b) services related to issuance of certificates; and (c) other services related to certificates, including but not limited to verification services.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.11.2 CD Service Providers. Although the Software provides CD authoring and validation features, Adobe does not supply the necessary CD Services required to use these features. Purchasing, availability and responsibility for the CD Services are between you and the CD Service Provider. Before you rely upon any CD, any digital signature applied thereto, and/or any related CD Services, you must first review and agree to the applicable Issuer Statement and this agreement. &quot;Issuer Statement&quot; means the terms and conditions under which each CD Service Provider offers CD Services (see the links on http://www.adobe.com/security/partners_cds.html ), including for example any subscriber agreements, relying party agreements, certificate policies and practice statements, and Section 14.11 of this agreement. By validating a CD using CD Services, you acknowledge and agree that (a) the certificate used to digitally sign a CD may be revoked at the time of verification, making the digital signature on the CD appear valid when in fact it is not; (b) the security or integrity of a CD may be compromised due to an act or omission by the signer of the CD, the applicable CD Service Provider, or any other third party; and (c) you must read, understand, and be bound by the applicable Issuer Statement.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.11.3 Warranty Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability. CD Service Providers offer CD Services solely in accordance with the applicable Issuer Statement. EXCEPT AS MAY BE PROVIDED IN AN ISSUER STATEMENT, YOUR USE OF CD SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. SEE SECTIONS 7 AND 8 FOR WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS WHICH GOVERN CD SERVICES.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.11.4 Indemnity. You agree to hold Adobe and any applicable CD Service Provider (except as expressly provided in its Issuer Statement) harmless from any and all liabilities, losses, actions, damages, or claims (including all reasonable expenses, costs, and attorneys fees) arising out of or relating to any use of, or reliance on, any CD Service, including, without limitation (a) reliance on an expired or revoked certificate; (b) improper verification of a certificate; (c) use of a certificate other than as permitted by any applicable Issuer Statement, this agreement or applicable law; (d) failure to exercise reasonable judgment under the circumstances in relying on the CD Services; or (e) failure to perform any of the obligations as required in an applicable Issuer Statement.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.11.5 Third Party Beneficiaries. You agree that any CD Service Provider you utilize will be a third party beneficiary with respect to this Section of this agreement and that such CD Service Provider will have the right to enforce such provisions in its own name as if the CD Service Provider were Adobe.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.12 Acrobat Professional Feature.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.12.1 Definitions.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.12.1.1 &quot;Deploy&quot; means to deliver or otherwise make available, directly or indirectly, by any means, an Extended Document to one or more recipients.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.12.1.2 &quot;Extended Document&quot; means a Portable Document Format file manipulated by Acrobat Professional Software to enable the ability to locally save documents with filled-in PDF forms.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.12.2 If the Software includes Acrobat Professional, the Software includes enabling technology that allows you to enable PDF documents with certain features through the use of a digital credential located within the Software (&quot;Key&quot;). You agree not to access, attempt to access, control, disable, remove, use or distribute the Key for any purpose.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.12.3 For any unique Extended Document, you may only either (a) Deploy such Extended Document to an unlimited number of unique recipients but shall not extract information from more than five hundred (500) unique instances of such Extended Document or any hardcopy representation of such Extended Document containing filled form fields; or (b) Deploy such Extended Document to no more than five hundred (500) unique recipients without limits on the number of times you may extract information from such Extended Document returned to you filled-in by such Recipients. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, obtaining additional licenses to use Acrobat Professional shall not increase the foregoing limits (that is, the foregoing limits are the aggregate total limits regardless of how many additional licenses to use Acrobat Professional you may have obtained).&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.13 Acrobat 3D Capture Utility.

Subject to the Contribute Publishing Services software end user license agreement accompanying such software, you shall not connect to the Contribute Publishing Services software unless you have purchased a license to connect to such Contribute Publishing Services software for each individual who may connect to such Contribute Publishing Services software; provided, however, Trial Versions of Adobe Contribute software may install and connect to the Contribute Publishing Services software in accordance with the Contribute Publishing Services software end user license agreement.&lt;br&gt;&#013;&lt;br&gt;&#013;14.18 ColdFusion Report Builder: You may install and use the Software on as many single computers as you need.

The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international treaty provisions.&#013;ONE LICENSE REQUIRED PER DEVELOPER&#013;Use of EXTENSION requires one license per developer. Licenses are non-transferable between developers. For instance, if a company has two developers that will use the EXTENSION, then that company requires two licenses. This is the case even if the developers will not be working with the EXTENSION at the same time or a project is transferred from one developer to another.&#013;DISTRIBUTION&#013;1. DMXzone grants you, the licensed developer, the right to use the EXTENSION, in all websites developed by you, and distribute the produced SOURCE CODE, without any royalty whatsoever, provided that :&#013;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You do not distribute the EXTENSION and SOURCE CODE or part of it, as a new Dreamweaver Extension or as a resulting product that might compete with DMXzone's EXTENSION and SOURCE CODE on the market level.&lt;/li&gt;&#013;&lt;li&gt;You do not permit (either by explicit or implicit means) further distribution of the DMXzone's EXTENSION and SOURCE CODE by your end users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#013;2. As a result of point 1, if you add some features into the EXTENSION and SOURCE CODE and sell it as &quot;upgraded product&quot;, it is not allowed, since, in essence, the product offers the same purpose, and it may actually compete with our EXTENSION and SOURCE CODE. Also, migrating the EXTENSION and SOURCE CODE to another server platform or translating the EXTENSION and SOURCE CODE to use another languages is not allowed as well. You must include the SOURCE CODE to your product / project only as a supporting functions / add-on facility, and it is not the main / core functionality of DMXzone's EXTENSION and SOURCE CODE that your product offers.&#013;3. As a result of point 1, you do not redistribute DMXzone's EXTENSION and SOURCE CODE in an Open Source project/application.&#013;4. A single license provides unlimited distribution of a single application that uses DMXzone's EXTENSION and SOURCE CODE functionality. Additional licenses must be purchased for royalty free distribution of any additional applications.&#013;UPGRADES&#013;If the EXTENSION and SOURCE CODE is an upgrade from another product, you may use that upgraded product only in accordance with this EULA.&#013;TERMINATION&#013;Without prejudice to any other rights, DMXzone may terminate this EULA if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this EULA. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the EXTENSION and SOURCE CODE and all of its component parts.&#013;LIMITED WARRANTY&#013;Although DMXzone has tested this EXTENSION and SOURCE CODE and reviewed the documentation, DMXzone makes no warranty or representation, either expressed or implied, with respect to this EXTENSION and SOURCE CODE, its quality, performance, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.
